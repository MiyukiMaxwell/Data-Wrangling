Main steps of this project:


Gather two datasets - successfully extract data using two different data gathering methods and combine the data.  
Assess the data according to quality and tidiness metrics, identifying missing data.  
Clean the data to solve the issues found in the assessing step.  
Update the data store with the cleaned data.  
Produce visualizations on the cleaned data, and answer a brief research question on the dataset.  

In the end, I completed the data-wrangling process on two datasets and generated visualisations.
